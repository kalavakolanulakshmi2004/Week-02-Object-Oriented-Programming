# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
This week focused on understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and how Java implements them using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\

Overview\
Week 2 was all about diving deeper into Java's core programming paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming. We explored how to design classes and objects, use important keywords, and apply key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism to write modular, reusable, and scalable code.\
Topics Covered
# Day 1: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals
  What is OOP?\
  Four main pillars: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism\
  Real-world analogies of objects and classes\
  Defining and creating Java classes and objects
# Day 2: Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers
  What are constructors and their types (default, parameterized)?\
  `this` keyword in constructor chaining\
  Difference between instance and class (static) variables\
  Access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default
# Day 3: `this`, `static`, `final` Keywords and `instanceof` Operator
  `this` keyword: reference to current object\
  `static` keyword: class-level fields and methods\
  `final` keyword: constant variables, final methods and classes\
  `instanceof` operator: runtime type checking
# Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagrams
  Understanding object modeling\
  How to design a class based on real-world entities\
  UML class diagrams: structure, attributes, methods, and relationships
# Day 5: Inheritance
  Concept of inheritance and its benefits\
  `extends` keyword for class inheritance\
  Superclass and subclass relationship\
  Method overriding and use of `super`
# Day 6: Encapsulation, Interface, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism
  Encapsulation: access control and data hiding\
  Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes\
  Implementing interfaces and abstract methods\
  Runtime polymorphism using method overriding\
